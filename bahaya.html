<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert"> <p>
	1. Damaging the liver: Methanol compounds that enter the body will turn into like formaldehyde that can damage the liver within a few hours. Methanol first becomes a harmful acidic substance when swallowed.
</p>
  </div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  <p>
	2. Poisoning: A person who consumes Methanol will feel nausea and headache like someone who is poisoned. Of course, because Methanol is a toxic compound, consumers who consume it will be poisoned.
</p>
 </div>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <p>
	3. Seizures: After poisoning, the consumer can also instantly cramps due to his body that rejects the poison from Methanol enter. Seizures can occur for up to four hours.
</p>
 </div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  <p>
	4. Nerve damage: Another danger is the occurrence of nerve damage to the body and even nerves can not function. You know that our whole body is made up of nerves connecting each other.
</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <p>
	5. Muscle can not be moved: Methanol consumer body will feel difficult digerakan because of muscle - muscle tension. Consumers will be rigid and difficult to do anything.
</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  <p>
	6. Shortness of breath: Methanol compounds that are inhaled will also cause shortness of breath. Not a few teenagers who use Methanol compounds to be inhaled.
</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
 <p>
	7. Damage to the skin: Skin dropped or touched Methanol compounds can also be damaged with symptoms of itching, dryness, to irritation. That's why Methanol should not be touched directly by our skin.
</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  <P>
	8. Death: Finally, the most menacing danger is death. As already told that not a few have to die from consuming Methanol. It is clear that Ethanol can be consumed only dangerous, how Methanol that it should not be consumed.

	That's some health information about the dangers of methanol compounds for the health of the body you need to know. Hopefully the above information is useful for you and your family in knowing the pharmaceutical world related to the ingredients in it. This information can also tell everyone around you.

  <h4 class="alert-heading">BE WARRANTED BY POISONS BY METHANOL ABUSE</h4>
  <p>You must have heard what methanol is. Methanol is the simplest part of alcohol that is usually widely used in industry.


This methanol is a light liquid, colorless, volatile, and easily burned. Methanol also has a distinctive and toxic odor.

The use of methanol in the industrial world is for house paint, adhesives / glue, foam pillows, synthetic textiles, recycled plastics, and as fuel.

Methanol is usually used as a liquor manufacture. Methanol has a relatively cheap price that is often used as a substitute for ethanol in liquor.

Unfortunately, not many know that the effects of methanol in these drinks are very harmful for people who consume them, one of which can cause addiction.

Even more dangerous is the consumption of illegal liquor or oplosan which is usually mixed with methanol in significant amounts.

Methanol is already in the body will be easily absorbed in body fluids. The harmful elements of methanol here are the metabolites that can cause asidosic metabolic, permanent blindness, and death after passing a latent period of 6-30 hours.

In many cases, it was found that the methanol content in liquor that the victim drank is quite high and it could be the metabolite contained in methanol that is one of the causes.

The question is, how can methanol poison the body? The methanol that has entered the body will be metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (DHA) to formaldehyde and then converted again into formic acid. Both substances are metabolic substances are harmful and toxic to the body, especially formic acid.

In the case of methanol poisoning, formaldehyde is never detected in the victim's body fluids because the formaldehyde formed is rapidly converted to formic acid and subsequently takes a long time (approximately 20 hours) by a 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate synthetase (F-THF-S) to oxidize formic acid into carbon dioxide and water compounds so that there is a correlation between the concentration of formic acid in body fluids with the case of methanol poisoning.

SYMPTOMS OF METHANOL FERING
At first people who experience this methanol poisoning will feel the disturbances that occur in the digestive tract such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Symptoms are then followed by depression in the central nervous system and seen symptoms very similar to victims who experienced alcohol poisoning such as headaches, muscle pain, weak body, convulsions, and others. And if not immediately helped it will happen things as follows:

Optic nerve damage: The symptoms experienced include pupil dilation, blurred vision, and ultimately permanent blindness.
Other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, breathing becomes deeper and faster, blood pressure decreases, shock then coma, and eventually dies.
What to do if you or someone next to you has symptoms of methanol poisoning? If swallowed, then the step should be done is immediately contact the nearest doctor and do not be stimulated to vomit.

If inhaled, this condition can be handled by moving the victim to a fresh place of air and rested. If necessary, attach a mask or similar device to perform artificial respiration and contact your nearest physician immediately.

When exposed to eyes, wash the eyes with plenty of running water while the eyes are blinked until it is certain to be free from methanol and consult a doctor immediately.</p>
